"""Tests for the pipeline scanner (see .claude/plans/2026-09-26-pipeline-diagram.plan.md).

The scanner builds one model of the delivery pipeline from the files that
actually define it, so the README's diagram can be generated instead of
hand-maintained in five places that drift apart.

Everything here runs against a fixture directory: no Docker, no git repo, no
network. The scanner is pure file-reading, and keeping these tests hermetic is
what lets them assert things that would be destructive to assert for real
(deleting a hook, removing the rules file).
